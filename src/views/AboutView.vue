<!--      <h1>Project Summary</h1>-->
<!--      <ul class="list">-->
<!--          <li>Vue.js Setup: The developer started the project by setting up a Vue.js application using Vue CLI, which provided a solid foundation for building the frontend.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Components and Templates: Multiple Vue components were created to modularize the application, each with its own template and script. This allowed for encapsulating functionality and reusing code efficiently.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Routing: Vue Router was implemented to enable client-side navigation and create a smooth, single-page application experience. Routes were defined for different pages, and the router-view was used to render the appropriate components based on the current URL.</li>-->
<!--          <li>State Management with Vuex: Vuex was integrated to manage the application's state across components. This centralized the data and shared it seamlessly between components, improving data flow and reactivity.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Dynamic Language Switching: The developer added language localization support using Vue I18n. This allowed providing translations for different languages and switching between them dynamically in the application.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Dropdown Language Selector: A custom dropdown language selector component was built to display a list of supported languages. The dropdown also closed when clicking outside the menu, providing a user-friendly experience.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Responsive Design: The application's layout and components were made responsive across various devices and screen sizes. This improved the user experience and accessibility.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Styling and CSS: Custom styles and CSS were applied to create an aesthetically pleasing user interface. Scoped CSS was used to keep the styles encapsulated within each component.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Fetching Images: Flag images for the language dropdown were fetched from external URLs and displayed alongside the language options.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Error Handling: Error handling was implemented to gracefully handle runtime errors and display meaningful error messages to users if anything went wrong.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Testing and Debugging: Throughout the development process, the application was tested, and bugs were identified and debugged to ensure its stability and smooth functionality.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Code Refactoring and Optimization: Continuous code refactoring and optimization were done to improve maintainability, readability, and performance of the codebase.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Documentation: The developer documented the code, explaining its functionality and purpose, making it easier for others to understand and collaborate on the project.</li>-->
<!--          <li>Version Control: Version control with Git was used, making it easy to track changes, collaborate, and revert to previous states if needed.</li>-->
<!--      </ul>-->
